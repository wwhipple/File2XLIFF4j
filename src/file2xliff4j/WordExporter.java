 * Class to export XLIFF to an Microsoft Word format.

    /** 
     * Convert one set of targets (in the translation units of an XLIFF file) back
     * to a document in the original Microsoft Word format. Use (besides the XLIFF
     * file) the skeleton and format files that were generated when the XLIFF file was created.
     * <p>This implementation first calls its superclass (OOoTextExporter), which
     * exports the XLIFF to OpenDocument.org Text format. After that call returns,
     * this method uses OpenOffice.org to convert the OpenOffice.org OpenDocument 
     * Text (odt) file to Word format.
     * @param mode The mode of conversion (FROM_XLIFF in this case.).
     * @param language The language of the XLIFF targets to use in constructing
     *        the Word document. The language is used in constructing a unique
     *        name for the output file. For example, if ja_JP is specified and
     *        the original input file was named myfile.odt, the output file name
     *        is myfile.ja_jp.odt. (Note that the Java Locale's toString
     *        method lowercases the characters of language codes.)
     * @param phaseName The name of the phase to export. If this parameter's
     *        value is not null, it is matched against the value of the 
     *        optional phase-name attribute of the target elements of the
     *        XLIFF document. If null, no check is made against a phase-name
     *        attribute.
     *        <p>If the phase name string consists entirely of numeric digit(s) 
     *        equivalent to an integer with value greater than 1 but less than 
     *        or equal to maxPhase (see next parameter) search for targets with 
     *        lower numbered phase names.
     * @param maxPhase The maximum phase number. If phaseName is specified as 
     *        "0" and maxPhase is a non-negative integer, search for the highest 
     *        "numbered" phase, starting at maxPhase, and searching down to phase
     *        "1".
     * @param nativeEncoding The encoding of the input file. This parameter is
     *        ignored for Word documents.
     * @param nativeFileType The type of the original native file. (This value
     *        isn't really needed for export, for two reasons:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Because the Word Exporter is being called, we assume that the type
     *     is WORD.
     * <li>The XLIFF that will be exported includes the original native file
     *     type in the datatype attribute of its file element.
     * </ol>
     * This parameter is present solely for consistency with the convert method
     * of importers--importers need the file type to place in the XLIFF file.)
     * @param nativeFileName The name of the original file that was previously 
     *        converted to XLIFF. (It will likely be a file whose filename ends 
     *        in ".doc"). This name is used for (at least) two purposes:
     * <ol>
     * <li>As a "root" file name to which suffixes (like ".xliff", ".skeleton",
     *     etc.) can be appended to construct the xliff, skeleton, etc. files
     *     that will be exported to the output document.
     * <li>(Hmmm... When I wrote this yesterday, I had two purposes in mind.
     *     ... but someone interrupted me, and today I can't recall what the
     *     second purpose was. Feel free to edit this if you can figure it
     *     out.)
     * </ol>
     * @param baseDir The directory that contains the input doc file--from which
     * we will read the input file. This is also the directory in which the output
     * xliff, skeleton and format files (and any other intermediate or
     * temporary files) will be written.
     * @param notifier Instance of a class that implements the Notifier
     *        interface (to send notifications in case of conversion error).
     * @param boundary (Ignored. The boundary on which to segment translation 
     *        units (e.g., on paragraph or sentence boundaries) is meaningful
     *        only for importers--converters that generate XLIFF from documents.)
     * @param generatedFileName If non-null, the converter will write the name
     *        of the file (without parent directories) to which the generated
     *        output file was written.
     * @return Indicator of the status of the conversion.
     * @throws file2xliff4j.ConversionException
     *         If a conversion exception is encountered.

     *        converted to XLIFF. (It will likely be a file whose filename ends 
     *        in ".doc"). This name is used for (at least) two purposes:
     * <ol>
     * <li>As a "root" file name to which suffixes (like ".xliff", ".skeleton",
     *     etc.) can be appended to construct the xliff, skeleton, etc. files
     *     that will be exported to the output document.
     * <li>(Hmmm... When I wrote this yesterday, I had two purposes in mind.
     *     ... but someone interrupted me, and today I can't recall what the
     *     second purpose was. Feel free to edit this if you can figure it
     *     out.)
     * </ol>
     * @param baseDir The directory that contains the input doc file--from which
     * we will read the input file. This is also the directory in which the output
     * xliff, skeleton and format files (and any other intermediate or
     * temporary files) will be written.
     * @param notifier Instance of a class that implements the Notifier
     *        interface (to send notifications in case of conversion error).
     * @return Indicator of the status of the conversion.
     * @throws file2xliff4j.ConversionException
     *         If a conversion exception is encountered.
